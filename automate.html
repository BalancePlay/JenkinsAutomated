With the help of Git fork we'll automate the process of git push automated
We will also take help of Jenkins
We will use Jenkins to clone from SCM(Github)
We have set Build perodically in jenkins that will help us automate the process of Checking Github and cloning
<p> Now we have set the Jenkins Scheduler to * * * * * in Poll SCM which means whenever we make changes to the code, Jenkins will clone and copt to the webserver config file in /var/www/html in RHEL8</p>
